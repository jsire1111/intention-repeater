## --> TO ANYONE READING THIS ON MY PERSONAL GITHUB <--

### BEGIN jsire1111

I have forked both the original *Intention Repeater* and *Intention Repeater*, CUDA version from [tsweet77](https://github.com/tsweet77):

[twseet77/intention-repeater](https://github.com/tsweet77/intention-repeater)

[tsweet77/repeater-max-cuda](https://github.com/tsweet77/repeater-max-cuda)

I have done this so that I may freely restructure the repo and history in a way that makes sense to me.

Eventually, I will start refactoring, as I would like to try utilizing this on a cloud-hosted GPU Jupyter Notebook.

Everything currently outside this one block of text is from the original author. Please visit the original repos or the [Intention Repeater](https://www.intentionrepeater.com/) website for more information.

Thank you and namaste.

Hello All,

Introducing my free, open-source Intention Repeater. It repeats your intention 1+ Million times per second. So, if you use “I am calm” for instance, it will most likely calm you if you are open minded and energy sensitive. It works with what's called a Servitor (programmed intelligent energy) 2000+ hours/20 years in co-creation with 100’s of other entities. It can be used for affirmations, or to charge up objects. See the PDF in this project for info on how to charge up an object. The Servitor in this case is the black hole system HR 6819.

You probably want intention_repeater.py

Note, when available, use the C++ files, as they are the most up to date and superseed the Python versions.

On 64-bit (for g++): MingW-W64-builds: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe/download

On 32-bit, or if you only have 4GB of RAM (for g++): https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/

I placed this into open source in order that it might be developed and improved upon.

Instructions for automating in v6.0+ are at: https://www.intentionrepeater.com/usage.html

The Intensity determines how many 0's are in the number of iterations per second, minus one.
So Intensity of 1 would be one iteration per second. Intensity of 7 would be 1 million iterations per second,
depending on the hardware. If your hardware can't do 10 million iterations per second, then
Intensity of 8 would be full power after one million iterations per second.

Start with an Intensity of 7 and run until it feels like enough. You may want to stay under 2 hours per day at first.

Sample intentions are:

My heart is filled with Love.

I am calm and confident.

My dogs are healed.

My chakras are balanced.

I am filled with orgasmic bliss.

You can run an intention file (with many intentions) by running the filename, such as: sample_intentions.txt

You can charge up an image, like so: Picture1.jpg is perfectly and euphorically healed.

That last one allows images to be used just from the name of the file, if it is in the same folder as the .py file.
Just substitute with the name of your image.

Feel free to play around with this software, and add to the project if you are able.

There are no guarantees. Though this program produces a strong energy field, and can produce profound bliss.

Thank You.

On Linux/MacOS, run using: python3 intention_repeater.py
On Windows: double click on the intention_repeater.py icon.

You will need minimum version 3.5.3 of Python for the .py files.
